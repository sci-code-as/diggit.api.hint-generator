UX STYLE HINT
- A statement assigning day to the value a call of the function
 a call of the function datetime.datetime.strptime with arguments: 
 ,date, and the string `'%d %m %Y'`.weekday with arguments: 

- you should start using the method strptime from your import datetime: try calling it like this
datetime.strptime()
- strptime takes a string of a date and turns it into an integer with a special formatting argument,
try strptime("may 25,2015", '%B %d', %Y'). 
where (%B) is the full month
where ($d) is a two digit day like 26
where %Y is the 4 digit year like 2020 our current year

-finally use the .weekday() method to change your converted date to string into a converted
number indicating the day of the week . for example, (2020, 6,1, 13,30 ).weekday() = 0 
as Monday is 0

-Dont forget to use the calendar module's method calenday.day_name[day] to convert your number to a string day
